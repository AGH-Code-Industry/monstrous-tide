# Files database and tagging

This feature is provided by the *Dataview* plugin, which allows us to explore files easier and search faster through them.

For everything related to tagging, please visit [[Vault's tagging, properties and metadata|this file]].

>[!attention]- Obsidian Community plug-in
>This document uses *Table Extended* community plug-in. Please, install it in order to properly see below contents, if it is incomprehensive/bugged. It's absolutely safe and will apply only to this vault. 
>
>To do so, go to *Settings*, then *Community plug-ins*, turn on the plugins, download *Table extended* plugin by AidenLX, turn it on in plugins tab and **also turn it on in *Table extended* settings** below. You may need to re-open this vault to force Obsidian to read the plug-in.

# About this vault 

> Hello, this is Monstrous Tide project's Obsidian vault, this file is a basic introduction to contents of this directory.

*Please, keep this documentation - and everything, actually - in English.*

# About exploring the files

We strongly recommend reading this documentation in reading mode (which you can enable in right top corner clicking on the book icon, which will then switch to pen icon). 

# About plug-ins

In this documentation vault, we use *Table extended* and *Dataview* plugins. They are, so far, the only ones.

1. As stated in [[1. Code docs template|this file]], person writing and submitting the code shall be the one responsible for providing this code's documentation. Those docs ***shall be committed through one's current working branch***, not through *Docs* or any other.
2. If any conflicts or other unwanted things related to documentation occur, please contact documentation team.
3. Files named *\__Name__* are named this way to put them on the top of the directory - these files are the most important so far, as they provide all general information and guide you further, to other files.
