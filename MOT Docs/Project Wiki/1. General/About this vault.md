>Hello, this is Documentation vault of Monstrous Tide project by Zespół Totalnej Porażki. In this file you may find some basics regarding navigation over the directory and its contents.

# Generally speaking

*Everything should be in English, don't even try any other way*

We recommend reading our Markdown files in Obsidian's reading mode (in top right corner you should click a *book* icon, which shall change to *pen* afterwards).

***If you denied installing community plug-ins***, when opening this vault, we *strongly recommend* you do this, because without them all of it will look at least bad and (in some cases) it may just not work.

# Tables of contents

In [[Tables of contents|this file]] you will find a general guide to navigation over those docs. It contains links to all tables of contents, general descriptions files and our canvases - these are graphically composed sets of notes, links, etc.

# Tagging

If you provide any document, please also provide *tags* and *types* for each one - these are special files' properties (aka *metadata*) helping us organize this vault and automatize tables of contents (faster searching, cool shit ngl). 

>***So far, it only applies to "Project Wiki" section, to be announced for "Docs".***
