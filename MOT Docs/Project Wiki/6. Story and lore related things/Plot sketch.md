>[!info] Before reading
>The game's story will be rather short and not complex, without many in-depth details, which will allow the gameplay to be as planned: short and straightforward.
## Overview:

> *95% of the story will be delivered to the player through in-game items and maybe few easter-eggs. I suggest the remaining 5% to be delivered in some kind of pre-main-part stage/tutorial.*

Millennia ago, people were just living on the Earth. One day, under unknown circumstances they turned against their God and killed him. 

Little had they known, there was not only one god. Aom, The First Protector of Earth, was one of many gods taking care of the universe. The other gods, after witnessing the death of Aom, decided to punish the humanity and cursed them with Vampirism[^1] - they sent thousands of vampires/monsters to set chaos on the planet and make all of them suffer (those guilty and not).

After years of darkness, new god delegated to look after the planet decided it is time to bring back the humanity. Atman, The Second Protector of Earth, sent *Heroes*[^1] - foreign, gifted warriors - to fight off the Vampires and make space for another life to grow.

>[!tip] Advantages of this concept:
>- it allows the plot to be simple, unclear when needed, uncomplicated, maybe even unending;
>- it allows us to introduce new playable characters;
>- it allows us to introduce many *God-blessing-like* mechanics for weapons, stages, etc.;
>- it doesn't extort actually anything from us, everything may be justified and explained in almost every way.

>[!danger] Disadvantages of this concept:
>- sometimes may feel kind of underwhelming[^2];
>- nothing else.

[^1]: This name/title is probably up to change.
[^2]: Only *kind of* and in certain situations for certain people (i.e. for ones that want some greater lore).
