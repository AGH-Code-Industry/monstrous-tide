>This document provides insight on dodging system, description of this mechanic and more. As introduced in current [[__Statistics outline__|stats concept]], this is a suggestion, naturally[^1].


# Dodge stat values

*Dodge* shall be greater than 0 and less or equal to 100 (which shall be achievable only for a very short time period). Let the base *Dodge* value for every character be 5.[^1]

# Main principle

Only stat used here is *Dodge*[^2]. So far, a chance of dodging an attack is value of *Dodge* stat treated as a percentage value, i.e. $Dodge\%$. If an attack happens to be dodged, the incoming damage shall be zeroed; if not, it shall remain unchanged.




[^1]: Meaning it's up to be discussed and accepted.
[^2]: May it me influenced by *Luck* stat?
