>This document is a first outline of statistics system, what they are, what is their job and everything more needed at the moment.

>[!attention]- Obsidian Community plug-in
>This document uses *Table Extended* community plug-in. Please, install it in order to properly see below contents, if it is incomprehensive/bugged. It's absolutely safe and will apply only to this vault. 
>
>To do so, go to *Settings*, then *Community plug-ins*, turn on the plugins, download *Table extended* plugin by AidenLX, turn it on in plugins tab and **also turn it on in *Table extended* settings** below. You may need to re-open this vault to force Obsidian to read the plug-in.

***Important to note:*** There is no rule that *every* weapon should have *every* stat - it is acceptable that weapons have different stats.
