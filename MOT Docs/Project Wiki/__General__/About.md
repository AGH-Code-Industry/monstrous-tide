> Hello, this is Monstrous Tide project's Obsidian vault, this file is a basic introduction to contents of this directory.


# Files database and tagging

This feature will be provided with *Dataview* plugin, which will allow easier file exploration and faster searching for desired information.

# About exploring the files

In near future there will be added some metadata features, such as tags filtering and file collecting all other, via *Dataview* plugin. 

We strongly recommend reading this documentation in reading mode (which you can enable in right top corner clicking on the book icon, which will then switch to pen icon). 
# About plug-ins

In this documentation vault, we use *Table extended* plugin. It is, so far, the only one. In every file there is proper callout mentioning used plugin.

1. As stated in [[1. Code docs template|this file]], person writing and submitting the code shall be the one responsible for providing this code's documentation. Those docs ***shall be committed through one's current working branch***, not through *Docs* or any other.
2. If any conflicts or other unwanted things related to documentation occur, please contact documentation team.
3. Files named *\__Name__* are named this way to put them on the top of the directory - these files are the most important so far, as they provide all general information and guide you further, to other files.
