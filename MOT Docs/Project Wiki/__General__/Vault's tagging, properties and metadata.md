>This doc outlines how we use tags in our documentation. In case of any misunderstandings, contact our doc team.

# Plugin

Generally speaking, *tags* and *properties* may be used in vanilla Obsidian - no plugins, no problems. But we are people[^1] - plugin needed to use *Tags* in their best (thus desired by us) form is *Dataview*. 

Like in case of *Table Extended*, this should come to you preinstalled with the rest of the vault from our repo. If *somehow* not, do the following steps: 
1. disable *restricted mode* in *Settings*;
2. Find *Dataview* (and *Table extended*) in *Community plugins*, under *browse* button;
3. Install them and turn them on in their own settings, at the bottom of *Settings* menu;
4. (Optionally, but recommended) Reopen Obsidian.
# Purpose

*Tags* and *properties* are metadata which provide us with ability to:
- group certain files connected to each other;
- manage see them from one place, instead of jumping among them;
- have more fun with Obsidian[^1].

# Tags

*Tags* are added to the file in following way:

```
File Name

#tag/nested-tag/another-nested-tag
#another-tag/different-nested-tag
#yet-another-tag

# Some header
Some text ...
... 
```

***Note:*** It is, naturally, possible to add tags in other place in the file, but to keep the files readible, please keep them at the top.

# Properties
