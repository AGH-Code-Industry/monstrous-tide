> If you are new to our team, there are a few things to get straight - those regard working with [[Links|tools we use]]. If you have any trouble with Obsidian, check out our Discord or contact anyone of *Zespół Totalnej Porażki*, we will help!


*Trello* is a task-boards management tool developed by Atlassian. It is a simple but powerful app which helps us plan our work and track its progress.
# How you can use it

Well, there is [*Trello* website](https://trello.com) with everything we need. There are also Android and iOS mobile apps that give you access to *Trello* any time.
# At the very beginning

1. You should create your account, yes.
2. After you create it, contact team leaders (esp. Paweł Młodkowski) and send them your email - they will add you to our workspace.
3. There you are - you should be able to see *Monstrous Tide* workspace with our *Sprint* tables.
# A few terms

- A **sprint**[^1] is a time period for work over a decided set of tasks/works. In our project, it is usually 1-2 weeks.
- A **board** usually contains tasks of one *sprint*:
	- It is made of named **lists** which group our **task cards** by their current state, for example *not assigned*, *PR waiting* or *done*;
	- A named *card* contains *task*-related info, such as who is assigned to it or what category does it match (those are specified by coloured tags);

# Actual work

It is simple, very simple:

1. During a *sprint*-starting meeting you decide what *task* you want to work on:
	- It is usually created by the leader, but if it is not, you may create it (after contacting the leader, we should keep everything clear):
		- Name it properly;
		- Add a description, brief but comprehensive and precise;
		- Add proper tags;
	- You add yourself to the *card* by clicking *+* on its top or through *Members*;
	- You move the *card* to a proper *list* (click and drag).
2. While doing your job - and especially after finishing it - remember to move your done *task-card* to a proper *list*.

***Note:*** we do not usually keep informing about everything through *Trello* in *Activity* section of a card.
