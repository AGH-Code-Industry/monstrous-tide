## About exploring the files

In near future there will be added some metadata features, such as tags filtering and file collecting all other, via *Dataview* plugin. 

We strongly recommend reading this documentation in reading mode (which you can enable in right top corner clicking on the book icon, which will then switch to pen icon). 
## About plug-ins

In this documentation vault, we use *Table extended* plugin. It is, so far, the only one. In every file there is proper callout mentioning used plugin.
