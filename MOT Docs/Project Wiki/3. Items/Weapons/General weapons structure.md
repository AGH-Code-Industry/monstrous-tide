# Weapon characteristic

Weapon is a special item made for [[Damage calculations|dealing damage]] to opponents. It holds specified [[__Statistics outline__|statistics]] and may hold different types of [[Weapon progression outline|bonuses and upgrades]].

Weapons are distinguished by their: *Types*, *Tags* and *Rarities*. They have their own upgrade tree - those upgrades obey rules introduced [[Weapon progression outline|here]]. They may be even transformed into different weapons.

# Character's weapons

As described[^1] in [[Character outline|character draft]] file, a playable character (which is only type considered in this paragraph) has an *Inventory*, which is an array of items they can use. A character may have unlimited amount of weapons[^2] in their inventory, but *only 5* to use at the same time[^3].


[^1]: As *it will be* described, actually. Due to further upgrades, of course.
[^2]: Do we limit the inventory?
[^3]: An issue to discuss.
