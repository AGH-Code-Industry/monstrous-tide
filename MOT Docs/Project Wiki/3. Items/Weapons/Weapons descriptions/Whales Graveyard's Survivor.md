# General

This weapon will rather tank the player up - so much *ARM*, so much *Dodge*, so much *HP* bonus and so much *HPSteal*. It may also give bonuses based on mentioned stats.

It looks like a skeleton of a whale that floats above/beside/around the player slowly but elegantly.

# Combat info

This weapon will **upgrade no further** - it is a final form of *Cthulhu's Tantacle*.

## Stats

They shall be all inherited from the previous form of the *Tentacle*. 

## Principles

- this weapon gives the player following bonuses: +25% *MovSpeed*, +25% *Pickup*, +25% *ARM*, +20% *HP* and +20% *Dodge*;
- this weapon still deals single target damage - it shoots "bone" looking things into enemies:
	- every crit hit gives the player a + 20% *ARM* bonus for 10 seconds, which stacks up to three;
	- every time the player loses at least 5% *HP* at once, they gain +50% *HPSteal* for 3 seconds (**occurs only every 10 seconds**);
	- every time the player dodges, they gain +10% *CritChance* for 5 seconds - doesn't stack;

*...and indeed Atman DID WARN ME of this place - they even taught me a chant to call this little protector for me. It looks a little... weird. And does not fight most efficiently. But, Gods be blessed, this weirdo makes me feel so strong. Maybe now will I find the courage to come back to the depths and face him again, there...*
