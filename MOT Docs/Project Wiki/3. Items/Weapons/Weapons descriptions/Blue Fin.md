# General

It is a legendary upgrade to the *Tentacle*, which changes weapon's appearance into big blue fin, which rapidly spins around the player and hits enemies hard ~~as fuck~~.

The concept is this weapon is a cut-off limb of a [[Enemies concept list|fish-like boss enemy]], when it comes to lore.

# Combat info

This weapon will **upgrade no further** - it is a final form of *Cthulhu's Tentacle*.

## Stats

They shall be all inherited from the previous form of the *Tentacle*. 

## Principles

- this weapon has straightforward bonuses: *+55% DMG, +10% Dodge, +15% AOE, +10% HPSteal*;
- this weapon spins around the player:
	- it moves over a circle, where the circle's centre is current player's position and the radius is set and constant (*or maybe changing?*);
	- while doing so, it also is hitting every enemy it encounters:
		- it still is able to throw an enemy away, while following the same rules, as mentioned in *Tentacle's* description;
- it's blue.

# *[[Journal]]* entry

*Thinking over what I have done makes my thoughts output only one certain conclusion: no one is ever infallible and (most importantly) omnipotent. And naturally "no one" includes Rvhanbal. From now on, his blessed limb will follow only my orders and whims. Who would have ever thought that it may be this way?*

*My journey is not over nevertheless - it will take time. The waters, even though still, will not be as secure as they used to be so soon.*
