# General purpose and usage

*EXP points* (or just EXP for short) are gained by the player throughout the entire time, while playing. They are meant to enhance player's capabilities and damage output, which should help them encounter tougher enemies and stages.

They are used to upgrade player's weapons (precisely: their [[General statistics outline|statistics]]) and other side effects. Different [[Enemies concept list|enemies]] drop various numbers of EXP when defeated - these numbers depends on their "rarity" and "difficulty"[^1].
