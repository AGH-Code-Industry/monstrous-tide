>This document provides insight on dodging system, description of this mechanic and more. As introduced in current [[General statistics outline|stats concept]], this is a suggestion, naturally[^1].

# Main principle

Only stat used here is *Dodge*. So far, a chance of dodging an attack is value of *Dodge* stat treated as a percentage value, i.e. $Dodge\%$. If an attack happens to be dodged, the incoming damage shall be zeroed; if not, it shall remain unchanged.

For every separate attack, a *Dodge probability* should calculated. If it's an *AOE attack*, then it should be calculated for every separate DMG receiver[^2].
# Dodge stat values

*Dodge* shall be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. Let the base *Dodge* value for every character be 5.[^1]





[^1]: Meaning it's up to be discussed and accepted.
[^2]: Do we consider enemies to have this *Dodge* stat?
