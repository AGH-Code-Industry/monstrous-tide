*In accordance with our Google Drive and Miro, as of 30th Oct 2023.*

>Written below there are a few examples of biomes to include in our game - these should be related to works of our graphic team. As more biomes are added to the project, their separate descriptions will show up in different files here (this should be accepted by the team).

~~Excuse me being too much of Star Wars fanboy...~~

>[!info]- tl;dr
>- We have a plenty of examples, with *Caves*, *Cemetery* and *Catacombs* ones being described in the best way;
>- There are more enemies needed to be designed (which I will cover, see [[Enemies concept list|there]]);
>- Everything below requires team's approval.

# From Miro

**Base principles:**
1. Big maps - player should not see their borders;
2. Must contain *a lot* of enemies;
3. May be related to each other to emphasize the general game structure? (see [[General gameplay structure draft|there]]);
### 1. Caves:

- Shady places, with many various stone creations (f.e. stalactites, stalagmites, etc.);
- \[For gameplay clarity] not many corridors/narrow areas, many huge, flat spaces;
- Few light sources, maybe with limited visibility mechanic?
- Enemy pools: Golems;
- Inspirations taken from: Amnesia, Carrion (and maybe, as I wrote [[Biomes concept list#3. Ice caves|here]], a few ice caves, like in SWJFO);

### 2. Catacombs:

- Also shady, but with more space;
- Kind of 'ancient' feel to it;
- May cooperate well with deeper-lore discoveries;
- *\[My idea]* It may be a final stage of some cave-centered sector, also with one of first bosses, as introduced [[Enemies concept list|here]];
- Inspirations taken from: Amnesia, Hollow Knight, Darkest Dungeon;


### 3. Sewers[^1]

- Underground/undercity tunnels;
- ~~Wish I could say it is sort of steampunk vibe, but it may not work well with other biomes;~~
- Inspirations taken from: Darkest Dungeon, Stranger Sewers;

### 4. Cemetery (different from one I provided later):

- I like this 'hellish' vibe it has;
- A lot of vampires, blood spitting, maybe some map-exclusive health draining/damage over time mechanics? ~~Yes, please;~~
- Inspirations taken from: Darkest Dungeon II, Blasphemous;
- I would personally also add some big tomb battle after this map, which may be seen in this one from distance, such as below (there may be this big pile of bodies, like on screenshot from Miro):
![[swjfo_dathomir-tomb.jpg]]
$\quad$ Taken from Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, Dathomir planet;

### 5. Other examples:

- Fungal Wastes-styled biome like in Hollow Knight, i.e. some dark, deep forest and rich in fungi area (I guess);
- Weald-styled like in Darkest Dungeon, i.e. withered, reddish forest, with some abandoned weaponry;

___
# Other
### 1. Suburban graveyard:

- May be first or most basic biome, with basic [[Enemies concept list|enemies]];
- Dark/shady setting, not many working lights;
- Destroyed graves, fences, trees with no leaves;
- Pieces of corpse every here and there;
- Basic items and weapons drops[^2];
- Maybe for an intro?

### 2. Under-city dungeons

- Wet ground/puddles on the ground, withered soil;
- Maybe limited visibility mechanic?
- Specific enemies, like weird big insects???
- *tbc*

### 3. Ice caves

![[swjfo_crystal-caves.jpg]]
- Concept screenshot I took inspiration from (Star Wars Jedi - Fallen Order: Ilum, Crystal Caves);
- ^ This but darker, for whole project concept's purpose;
- Home to Ice Golems, Soil Golems, Stone Golems, maybe also to Bart? ([[Enemies concept list#Pool two - Golems|see here]])
