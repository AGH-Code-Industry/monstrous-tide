# From Miro

- Provided zombie-like enemies (styled like in Corpse Bride), *to be further covered*;
- Provided enemies styled like in Darkest Dungeon, *to be further covered*;
- Everything shall be cartoon/comics-like, especially bosses being Lovecraft-like;
- A few fish-based enemies, a concept of some watery scene? *to be further covered*

# "Fish-based" - name to be covered by lore

I have some idea for this enemies group lore, to be further covered (any suggestions are welcome ofc).

| **Species** | **Type/Name** | **Overall description** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| First Era Ocean Beings | Betta splendens | - fast, annoying, one hit enemy |\
| | | - low DMG, but really, *really* f__ing fast |\
| | | - high Dodge stat, like every second hit may be Dodged by this little being |
| ^^ | Xiphias Gladius | - leader of many groups of *Bettas* |\
| | | - fast moving and really hard hitting, a tonne of DMG (but slow ATKSpeed) |\
| | | - looks like miecznik, literally has a sword on their face (maybe fights with their face lol) |\
| | | - if low HP, scrifices 25% of alive *Bettas* nearby and recovers 35% their own HP |

# Lizard-like shit - name to be covered by lore

Names are absolutely dull atm, need to come up with ideas for them @Ania.

| **Race** | **Type/Name** | **Overall description** |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Pre-human Lizards | | |
| ^^ | Basic lizard warrior | - fast as f_ck |\
| | | - deals relatively low DMG, but slows down the player |\
| | | - when defeated, there is 50% chance of them to resurrect (max. once) |
| ^^ | Lizard warrior's group leader | - slower, but more HP |\
| | | - a little more DMG dealing, a little more ARM |\
| | | - if not defeated soon enough, calls another waves of basic warriors |
| ^^ | Lizard Necromant | - works a little like leader |\
| | | - when a lizard warrior is defeated (in a certain radius ofc), there is 100% chance for them to be resurrected *once* and then 50% to be res. another one time |\
| | | - is more tanky and faster, deals the same amt of DMG as leader |\
| | | - has cooler graphical design, like much cooler |
