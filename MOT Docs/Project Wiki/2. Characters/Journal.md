*Name to be discussed and changed.*

>This document provides a brief insight into the Journal - a diary of collectibles, such as achievements and other entries player may unlock.

# General

*Journal* itself is a collection of entries, which is locked/empty at first and unlocks/fills up with them with further player's progression. 

It includes character's entries, fallen enemies entries, biomes entries, legendary/mythic weapons entries and achievements.

# Icons

They should be small - grey/dark-ish at the beginning, and in normal colours when unlocked.

When hovered with cursor or clicked, there should occur a Journal entry (which every thing in this game will have) and a brief explanation how it became unlocked.

# Unlocking

Specified criteria for certain entries:
- *Enemies'* entries unlock when player defeats a certain type of enemy for the first time;
- *Items'* entries unlock when player unlocks or picks up an item for the first time;
- *Biomes'* entries unlock when player finishes their first stage in a biome;
- *Characters'* entries unlock[^1] when player finishes their first stage playing a character;

*Achievements* unlock when player meets more specific set of criteria - f.e. "Hit 10,000 DMG", "Complete a stage under *n* minutes", "Defeat a golem while under 5% HP", etc. ***\[To be introduced]***

[^1]: They unlock if we even consider different characters:)
