>[!question] I don't know if it's relevant in any way
>I don't think anyone has read this so far, so:
>- Should the characters themselves have any stats (*beside their weapons*)?
>- Do we even plan to introduce something more of a character system, or not?

___

*If you are searching for enemies ideas, look into [[Enemies concept list|this file]].*

>This file outlines essentials of each character. So far, it is only a draft, which is up to any further changes.

# Character's info

Each character has a name - if it is a playable one, it is their uniquely given name; if it is a NPC, they have names as provided in the [[Enemies concept list|enemies pool]]. Every one of them has their own appearance and animations.

Each character has their own stats, as detailed in [[General statistics outline|this file]]. - they are specific for any given character, whether it's a enemy or a playable one.

>[!attention] ***Important to note:*** every one of above statistics may be under buffs or debuffs. These mechanics require holding original, maximum, minimum and current stats' levels.

Characters per se do not have *EXP* bar - experience points belong to the player themselves and are distributed regardless of the active character.
# Equipment/Inventory

Player has a inventory[^1], in which they may hold different items: weapons, other combat related items[^2] and not-combat-related items.

The inventory is divided into *Equipped* and *Unequipped* parts. The first one consists of items currently used while playing, the second one is a storage for all other items belonging to the player, but not used.

### Equipped items

*Equipped* part is limited: it may only contain *maximum of 5 weapons and 5 other, combat related items*[^4] at any given time. These items may be changed by the player anytime[^3] through items menu and in any way player desires. Note that *not every item is equipabble*.

### Unequipped items

*Unequipped* inventory part is limitless: player may hold within it everything that is collectible and everything they are able to use, view, open, etc.

[^1]: What about the enemies? Especially considering code perspective.
[^2]: On our Miro board there is a mention of some kind of "*shield-providing cloak*" - do we really consider it? And if so, how?
[^3]: Maybe excluding some specific mechanics, that prevent the player from changing weapons for a certain time/stage?
[^4]: If there are any, beside weapons.
