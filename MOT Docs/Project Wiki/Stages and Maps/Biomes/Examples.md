>Written below there are a few examples of biomes to include in our game - these should be related to works of our graphic team. As more biomes are added to the project, their separate descriptions will show up in different files here (this should be accepted by the team).

### 1. Suburbian graveyard:

- May be first or most basic biome, with basic [[Concept list|enemies]];
- Dark/shady setting, not many working lights;
- Destroyed graves, fences, trees with no leaves;
- Pieces of corpse every here and there;
- Basic items and weapons drops[^1];
- Maybe for an intro?


[^1]: Due to further change, especially when introducing full weapon and item system.
