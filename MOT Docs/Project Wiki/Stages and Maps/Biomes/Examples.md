>Written below there are a few examples of biomes to include in our game - these should be related to works of our graphic team. As more biomes are added to the project, their separate descriptions will show up in different files here (this should be accepted by the team).

### 1. Suburbian graveyard:

- May be first or most basic biome, with basic [[Concept list|enemies]];
- Dark/shady setting, not many working lights;
- Destroyed graves, fences, trees with no leaves;
- Pieces of corpse every here and there;
- Basic items and weapons drops[^1];
- Maybe for an intro?

### 2. Under-city dungeons

- Wet ground/puddles on the ground, withered soil;
- Maybe limited visibility mechanic?
- Specific enemies, like weird big insects???
- *tbc*

### 3. Ice caves

![[swjfo_crystal-caves.jpg]]
- Concept screenshot I took inspiration from (Star Wars Jedi - Fallen Order: Ilum, Crystal Caves);
- ^ This but darker, for whole project concept's purpose;
- Home to Ice Golems, Soil Golems, Stone Golems, maybe also to Bart? ([[Concept list#Pool two - Golems|see here]])


[^1]: Due to further change, especially when introducing full weapon and item system.
