>This document briefly sums up the agreed way of upgrading the weapons and their whole life cycle.


# Obtaining weapons

The way of obtaining weapons is specific to every one of them and shall be described [[Weapons list|in the first place]] - those ways include dropping from specific enemies or from breaking items over the map.


# Levelling up

Weapons themselves *do not have a level* one may upgrade. 

On the other hand, weapons are made of [[Weapon stats|stats]] that may be increased by fighting further and further. After each [[Character levelling|player level up]], player will encounter a screen:
- containing *X*[^1] cards of upgrades:
	- each one card relating to *exactly one* weapon - even if they have multiple copies of the same item, the upgrades will be randomly linked to only one of them (which also means it's possible to simultaneously upgrade two copies of the same weapon in two different ways).
- these cards will be grouped by their [[__Rarity system sketch__|rarities]]:
	- there will be equal amount of upgrades of each rarity;
	- the player may choose one upgrade of each rarity once.
- mentioned upgrades will be distributed as follows:
*\[a table of exemplary upgrades grouped by rarities]*

# Considering evolving weapons

As mentioned above, those upgrades should transform our weapon into a new, special one.
