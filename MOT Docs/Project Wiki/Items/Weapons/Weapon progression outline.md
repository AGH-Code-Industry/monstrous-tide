>This document briefly sums up the agreed way of upgrading the weapons and their whole life cycle.


# Obtaining weapons

The way of obtaining weapons is specific to every one of them and shall be described [[Weapons list|in the first place]] - those ways include dropping from specific enemies or from breaking items over the map.


# Levelling up

Weapons themselves *do not have a level* one may upgrade. 

On the other hand, weapons are made of [[Weapon stats|stats]] that may be increased by fighting further and further. After each [[Character levelling|player level up]], player will encounter a screen:
- containing *X*[^1] cards of upgrades:
	- each one card relating to *exactly one* weapon - even if they have multiple copies of the same item, the upgrades will be randomly linked to only one of them (which also means it's possible to simultaneously upgrade two copies of the same weapon in two different ways).
- these cards will be grouped by their [[__Rarity system sketch__|rarities]]:
	- there will be equal amount of upgrades of each rarity;
	- the player may choose one upgrade of each rarity once.
- mentioned upgrades will be distributed as follows:
*\[a table of exemplary upgrades grouped by rarities]*

>[!attention] ***Suggestions***
>With provided rarities, I suggest:
>- *Basic* being flat/low percentage random stat bonuses;
>- *Classic* and *Advanced* being higher percentage stat bonuses;
>- *Exotic* and *Legendary* being very high stat bonuses or/and additional weapons mechanics;
>- *Mythic* being evolution to a different weapon.
>
>When levelling up, the player may choose one of upgrades, where: *Basic* and *Classic* drop always; *Advanced* drops almost always; *Exotic*, *Legendary* and *Mythic* drop rarely, except the situation, when described upgrades are only upgrades left to be held by the weapon (then they also drop rarely, but they are only ones available for this weapon).
# Considering evolving weapons

As mentioned above, those upgrades should transform our weapon into a new, special one. 

>[!question] ***Suggestion*** 
>Regarding weapon [[Weapon types|types]] and [[Weapon sets|sets]], these should be the only keys to transformations.
>
>What I mean is weapon after the transformation should be chosen randomly, but of the same type and set as the basic one. 
>
>*Example*:
>There is a set of weapons called *A* - within the *A* set there are a few weapons, some of them are *Advanced* and there are a few *Mythic* weapons. If player rolls a *Mythic* upgrade for a *Advanced* weapon they have from *A* set, this will upgrade this weapon into a *Mythic* weapon from the same *A* set **and** it will be of the same [[Weapon types|type]][^2].




[^1]: An issue to discuss - how many, considering suggested [[__Rarity system sketch__|rarity system sketch]]?
[^2]: Weapon types are to be introduced.
