>This document describes what are tags, what they are used for, what are their types and more. So far, it is just a concept. *Do not mistake it for Obsidian tags! More [[Tagging, properties and metadata|here]].*

***Note:*** We *trashed* weapon sets concept - sets are now under the weapon tags umbrella, which means they work the same way as assumed in the first place, but are technically tags.

# General

*Weapon tag* is a special weapon property - it point specific weapon "groups" said weapon should be included in. For one weapon, they are constant and do not change throughout the game.

It is used for grouping/ordering purposes and for enabling special, tag-dependant mechanics for weapons[^1].

# Exemplary tags and their properties




[^1]: Are those mechanics/bonuses just stuck to the tag itself, or should they be enabled by specific weapon's upgrades?
