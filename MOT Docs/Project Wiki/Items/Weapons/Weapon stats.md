- *ATKSpeed/CD* - specifies how much time shall last until next usage of the weapon;
- *ATKRad/AOE* - specifies area which weapon shall cover with damage[^1];
- *Multi/MULTI* - specifies possibility of attacking another time in a time period[^2];
- *Dur/DUR* - specifies amount of time for which player is allowed to use the weapon;
- *HPSteal* - specifies amount of HP which will be additionally regenerated for the player after damaging an enemy;
- *Luck* - specifies possibility of critical hit and increases rare item/upgrades drop-rate (0%-100%)

# Stats progression regarding their rarity
