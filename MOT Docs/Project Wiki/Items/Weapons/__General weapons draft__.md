>This document outlines how weapons shall be implemented, what they will contain, how they should progress and everything else needed at the start.

# Weapon characteristic

Weapon is a special item made for [[Damage calculations|dealing damage]] to opponents. It holds specified [[__Statistics outline__|statistics]], which can be further levelled up and rolled into new or different bonuses.

Weapons are distinguished by their: *Types*, *Tags*, *Sets*, *Statistics* and *Rarities*. They have their own levelling tree, each consisting of separate paths in which player may roll upgrades for the weapon - which is *randomized*.
# Character's weapons

As described[^1] in [[__Character outline__|character draft]] file, a playable character (which is only type considered in this paragraph) has an *Inventory*, which is an array of items they can use. A character may have unlimited amount of weapons[^2] in their inventory, but *only 5* to use at the same time[^3].


[^1]: As *it will be* described, actually. Due to further upgrades, of course.
[^2]: Do we limit the inventory?
[^3]: An issue to discuss.
