>To do so, go to *Settings*, then *Community plug-ins*, turn on the plugins, download *Table extended* plugin by AidenLX, turn it on in plugins tab and **also turn it on in *Table extended* settings** below. You may need to re-open this vault to force Obsidian to read the plug-in.
# General

| Tier name | Associated colour | General drop-rate principle | Number of slots |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *Basic* | Grey | 25.5% | 2 |
| *Classic* | Green | 35.5% | 3 |
| *Advanced* | Blue | 23.9% | 3 |
| *Exotic* | Red | 9.1% | 2 |
| *Legendary* | Gold | 4.9% | 1 |
| *Mythic* | Indigo | 1.1% | 1 |

Where associated colour may be used for graphic type design or something like that.

*General drop-rate principle* is here for a reference only, as there is no drop-rate dependant mechanic described so far.
# A little foreword

>[!tip]- Current weapon progression design
>Currently approved weapon progression design is described [[Weapon progression outline|here]]. It shall be followed in every other doc and aspect, until changed. It also shall follow current [[__Statistics outline__|stat system]].

>[!question]- ***This rarity concept***
>With provided rarities, I suggest:
>- *Basic* being flat/low percentage random stat bonuses;
>- *Classic* and *Advanced* being higher percentage stat bonuses;
>- *Exotic* and *Legendary* being very high stat bonuses or/and additional weapons mechanics;
>- *Mythic* being evolution to a different weapon.
>
>When levelling up, the player may choose one of upgrades, where: *Basic* and *Classic* drop always; *Advanced* drops almost always; *Exotic*, *Legendary* and *Mythic* drop rarely, except the situation, when described upgrades are only upgrades left to be held by the weapon (then they also drop rarely, but they are only ones available for this weapon).
>
>**Important:** Main rule is all upgrades are not reversible. 

>[!question]- ***Types and tags suggestion*** 
>Regarding weapon [[Weapon types|types]] and [[Weapon tags|tags]], these should be the only keys to transformations.
>
>What I mean is weapon after the transformation should be chosen randomly, but of the same type and having at least all the same tags as the basic one (may have more). 
>
>*Example*:
>There is a tag of weapons called *A* - among *A*-tagged weapons there are a few ones, some of them are *Advanced* and there are a few *Mythic* weapons. If player rolls a *Mythic* upgrade for a *Advanced* weapon they have *A*-tagged, this will upgrade this weapon into a *Mythic* weapon with the same *A* tag **and** it will be of the same [[Weapon types|type]] (which are yet to be introduced).
# Upgrades

Those will drop accordingly to their *General drop-rate principle*, unless a maximum number of stats of some rarity is reached or it is last upgrade chance and some stat is yet to be chosen.

In other words, the game should actually *force* the player to have set amount of each stat upgrade.

***Important to note:*** 
- Those bonuses shall be applicable to the discussed weapon, i.e. weapon should make use of the provided stat bonus.


## Basic

Little/low *ATKSpeed/CD*, *Dur*, *HPSteal*, *AOE* (generally kind of unimportant) stats upgrades, for example[^3]\:
- \+1 *ATKSpeed*;
- \+1-5 sec *Dur*;
- \+1-5% *HPSteal*;
- \+1-20 points or \+1-5% *AOE*;
- \+1-10 *DMG*;
- ...

## Classic 

Higher valued but not overly game-changing upgrades, may regard all the stats, for example:
- \+ 0.5-9% *Dodge*;
- \+ *x* points *Pickup*;
- +0.2-5% *CritChance*;
- +1-10% *CritDMG*;
- \+2-10% *ATKSpeed*;

## Advanced

Decently-scaled stat bonuses, regarding all the stats, but usually those *more-wanted* ones, for example:
- +10-15% *CritChance*
- +20-60% *DMG*
- +50-75% *ATKSpeed*
- +25-50% *AOE*
- and so on...
## Exotic

Provides *really highly scaled* stat bonuses or simple additional mechanics for the weapon or current character, for example:

- +150% *DMG*
- +50% *Multi*
- +25% *CritChance*
- +65% *CritDMG*
- "This weapon has additional +15% *CritChance* and +15% *HPSteal* against all Vampires/Golems/etc., but has -10% *Multi* against others"
- "If this weapon scores a critical hit, player gains: +10% *Pickup*, +10% *HPRegen* and +10% *MovSpeed* for 10 seconds. May only occur every 10 seconds."
- "This weapon has 45% chance to heal the player by 5% of their *MaxHP* every 5 seconds."
## Legendary

Regarded a *powerful mechanic* tier - provides high QoL boost to current weapon, for example:
- "Whenever an enemy is defeated with this weapon, player obtains incoming damage immunity for 10 seconds, +50% *HPSteal* and +50% *Multi*. May only occur every 60 seconds."
- "If this weapon's AoE attack deals damage to at least 10 enemies at once, this weapon gains +25% *CritChance*, +100% *AOE*, +100% *ATKSpeed* and +20% *DMG* bonuses for 5 seconds. May only occur if the current character is above 50% their *MaxHP* and every 15 seconds."
- and so on...

## Mythic

As stated above, it is an upgrade into a new weapon - rules of the evolution are as follows:
- upgraded weapon's stats stay the same, may be only enhanced;
- upgraded weapon gains one additional *Legendary* and *Mythic* upgrade, ***which cannot be chosen - these are fully random***;
- weapon gains new name/skin/animations/lore entry, etc.



[^3]: Dependant on stat scaling.
