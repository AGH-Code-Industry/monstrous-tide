- a card: "Bloodletting" (or anything that links to healing as it was very popular medical procedure for literally anything in Victorian England)
- a gravestone of Richard Pickman (this man appears in few stories of Lovecraft and is descripted as the mad man who found a way to transform himself into a ghoul)
-  tapes/recordings/letters of Henry Akeley (one of two main characters from story "The Whisperer in Darkness" who agreed to be abducted by Older Gods shaped crayfish-like from Pluto planet. Henry and narrator had corrensponded many times, sent the recordings of these creatures as the narror tried to keep Henry safe but he  h a d    c  h o s e n  to be transformed/abducted by those gods) 
- shoggoths as new enemies - they're from "At the Mountains of Madness" story (my absolutely fav) and are cave creatures, "*Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes - viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells - rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile - slaves of suggestion, builders of cities - more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and more imitative!*" (after HL himself)
  Shoggoths can kill by simply running into an enemy (and then they create underpressure that the enemy explodes! but it must be simplified for the game). If it's possible let's make their speed as much random and unpredictible (shortly: unstable and variable). Let them be slow and fast alternately.
- Cthulhu idol: just a thing to find, maybe some healer with the "It's wise of you to pray for your enemies death. Your request shall be heard." or sth like this
