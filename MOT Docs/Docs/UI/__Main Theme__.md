## Overview

The Main Theme is a critical asset in the game that defines the visual style of the user interface elements, including the progress bar, health bar and level up cards. It is defined in the `Theme.tres` file.

## Location

The Main Theme file, `Theme.tres`, is located in the directory `Assets/Resources`.

## Usage

The `Theme.tres` file is a Godot Engine theme resource file. It describes how interface items should look in the game. This includes, but is not limited to, the progress bar, the health bar and level up cards.

Please note that any changes to the theme should be made directly in the `Theme.tres` file. Be careful when editing this file, as changes will affect all interface items that use this theme.

## Interface Items

Here are some of the interface items that the Main Theme affects:

> **Progress Bar**: The Main Theme defines default visual style of the progress bar, which is used as the [[Experience Bar]].

> **Level Up Cards**: The Main Theme also affects the appearance of the [[Level Up Cards]] in four variants: Uncommon, Rare, Epic and Legendary. 

>**Health Bar**: The Main Theme defines visual style of the [[Health Bar]], which is displayed over the player and some of the enemies.
