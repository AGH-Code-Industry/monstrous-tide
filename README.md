# monstrous-tide

Hello, this is "Montrous Tide" game project by Zespół Totalnej Porażki of AGH Code Industry!

# About project

We work with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - a powerful, free and cross-platform game engine - to create something special: 
A multiplatform single-player game inspired by *Vampire Survivors* and Victorian London with some Lovecraft-like creatures wandering there... Who knows what happens (or will happen?) if you step too far?

# Our progress

We have been working over this project for a few months now. What we have done is:
- our first graphics, animations, functional units and other assets, which made ***our first demo!***;
- concepts introducing new weapons, units, biomes and some music;
- some cool, clean *GDScript* code to run;
- Markdown documentation vault, powered by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

# Running this thing

We do not yet have a stable release of our game, but if you want to see the project from backstage, you may:
1. Download our repo files;
2. Open the project with the newest **Godot** release - we try to use the latest stable one;
3. Open the *MOT Docs* folder as a vault in Obsidian, trust community plug-ins we use and enable *reading mode* - start with *Main Canvas* file!

# About the future

We hope to deliver our best in nearest future - so far we focus on polishing everything we have to provide the best we can for our presentation on [AGH GamesHall 2024](https://fb.me/e/6HcmINDxF)!

Stay tuned and be sure to see us at this event!
