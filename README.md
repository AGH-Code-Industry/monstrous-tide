# monstrous-tide

Hello, this is Montrous Tide game project by ZTP of AGH Code Industry! Happy to see you :)

## Our repository

We work with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - a powerful, free and cross-platform game engine - to create something special: 
A single-player game inspired by *Vampire Survivors* and Victorian London with some Lovecraft-like creatures wandering there... Who knows what happens (or will happen?) if you step too far?

## Our progress

We are at the very beginning of our journey, first assets, scripts and concepts are just being brought to the world...

## Do you want to download the repo?

While opening our GDScripts is a straightforward thing, our documentation doesn't show you its whole power on Github - to get the most of Markdown and community plugins, we use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a light-weight powerhouse of Markdown. All you need to do is download Obsidian, click "Open vault" and select "MOT Docs".
